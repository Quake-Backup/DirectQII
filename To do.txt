Timer catch up from debug break

dropped frames in cinematics (it's 2018, this shouldn't happen)
implement ri.Set2D/ri.End2D and bring on framework for vid.conwidth/vid.conheight

upscale pics/charset/numbers (but NOT conback) so that they'll look good at zoomed ortho views
alternatively push them to a different RT and blend-over when done

GLimp_AppActivate - does DXGI not do this for us????

Test video mode stuff with a clean config.

Menu background should be solid black if console is full-screen.

s_khz is wrong in the menu.

CVAR_VIDEO should not write to console if in the menus

Music sometimes stops when it shouldn't...

we have the palette on the VS as a texture so read it as a colour for beams (how???)

beam transform is messy - this should be quuuick and easy to calculate...

reduce number of cbuffers

shaders as embedded resources: 1: get them into the renderer lib, and 2: get a recompile of resources if they change.

screenshots without gamma or brightness
