Timer catch up from debug break

dropped frames in cinematics (it's 2018, this shouldn't happen)

GLimp_AppActivate - does DXGI not do this for us????

Test video mode stuff with a clean config.

CVAR_VIDEO should not write to console if in the menus

Music sometimes stops when it shouldn't...

we have the palette on the VS as a texture so read it as a colour for beams (how???)

beam transform is messy - this should be quick and easy to calculate...

reduce number of cbuffers

shaders as embedded resources: 1: get them into the renderer lib, and 2: get a recompile of resources if they change.

Add apply changes status bar to video options that need them, vsync shouldn't need it

Make a Com_ValidatePath for all the little cases of paths with "..", ".\", "./", etc.

Save/Load menu with mapshots/etc

Immutable resources - can textures be immutable?

Discard-free buffers: https://www.gamedevs.org/uploads/efficient-buffer-management.pdf

cBuffer updates via Map/Discard.
Don't update if nothing has changed (this may be more expensive to check than just updating...)

Best way to group dlights cbuffer.

LightVector is VS->PS varying?
Upload NormalMatrix per-entity.
Or do inverse-transform of LightPos in VS???

Batch updates to dynamic buffers (the code for this could get nasty...)
