Timer catch up from debug break

dropped frames in cinematics (it's 2018, this shouldn't happen)

GLimp_AppActivate - does DXGI not do this for us????

Test video mode stuff with a clean config.

CVAR_VIDEO should not write to console if in the menus

Music sometimes stops when it shouldn't...

we have the palette on the VS as a texture so read it as a colour for beams (how to send the correct index to the shader???)

beam transform is messy - this should be quick and easy to calculate...

shaders as embedded resources: 1: get them into the renderer lib, and 2: get a recompile of resources if they change.

Add apply changes status bar to video options that need them, vsync shouldn't need it

Make a Com_ValidatePath for all the little cases of paths with "..", ".\", "./", etc.

Save/Load menu with mapshots/etc

cBuffer updates via Map/Discard.
Don't update if nothing has changed (this may be more expensive to check than just updating...)

Batch updates to dynamic buffers (the code for this could get nasty...)

move screen functions from glw_imp/r_main/etc to r_screen.c

clean up Zone allocations

<<<<<<< HEAD
Input - if more than 500ms has passed since an input message, discard it.
=======
environment mapped alpha and water surfaces (rip from my Q3A code)
alpha of the surf is inverse intensity of the envmap (more opaque = less envmapping)

bind lightmaps to a single textuer rather than to 3
reduces number of texture array slots...
