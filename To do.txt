Timer catch up from debug break

dropped frames in cinematics (it's 2018, this shouldn't happen)

GLimp_AppActivate - does DXGI not do this for us????

Test video mode stuff with a clean config.

CVAR_VIDEO should not write to console if in the menus

Music sometimes stops when it shouldn't...

we have the palette on the VS as a texture so read it as a colour for beams (how???)

beam transform is messy - this should be quick and easy to calculate...

reduce number of cbuffers

shaders as embedded resources: 1: get them into the renderer lib, and 2: get a recompile of resources if they change.

Add apply changes status bar to video options that need them, vsync shouldn't need it

Make a Com_ValidatePath for all the little cases of paths with "..", ".\", "./", etc.

Save/Load menu with mapshots/etc

cBuffer updates via Map/Discard.
Don't update if nothing has changed (this may be more expensive to check than just updating...)

Batch updates to dynamic buffers (the code for this could get nasty...)

roll sprite constants into per-entity and build a billboarding matrix

roll cinematics into 2D constants stuff

move screen functions from glw_imp/r_main/etc to r_screen.c

split r_sky and r_warp from r_misc

reinstate sprite vertex buffer and get rid of the extra cbuffer
