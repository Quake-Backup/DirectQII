Timer catch up from debug break

dropped frames in cinematics (it's 2018, this shouldn't happen)

GLimp_AppActivate - does DXGI not do this for us????

Test video mode stuff with a clean config.

CVAR_VIDEO should not write to console if in the menus

Music sometimes stops when it shouldn't...

we have the palette on the VS as a texture so read it as a colour for beams (how???)

beam transform is messy - this should be quick and easy to calculate...

reduce number of cbuffers

shaders as embedded resources: 1: get them into the renderer lib, and 2: get a recompile of resources if they change.

Add apply changes status bar to video options that need them, vsync shouldn't need it

Make a Com_ValidatePath for all the little cases of paths with "..", ".\", "./", etc.

Save/Load menu with mapshots/etc

Discard-free buffers: https://www.gamedevs.org/uploads/efficient-buffer-management.pdf

cBuffer updates via Map/Discard.
Don't update if nothing has changed (this may be more expensive to check than just updating...)

Batch updates to dynamic buffers (the code for this could get nasty...)

encode trans33/trans66 into the texture image, put entity alpha back to the entity cbuffer, get rid of alpha cbuffer

wall and skin textures should read palette index 255 with it's correct original value

roll sprite constants into per-entity and build a billboarding matrix

roll cinematics into 2D constants stuff
