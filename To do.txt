"refusing to download a path with .." - for these
models/monsters/tank/../ctank/skin.pcx
models/monsters/ctank/skin.pcx

models/monsters/tank/../ctank/pain.pcx

they could be removed at load-time however...

dropped frames in cinematics (it's 2018, this shouldn't happen)

upscale pics/charset/numbers (but NOT conback) so that they'll look good at zoomed ortho views

GLimp_AppActivate - does DXGI not do this for us????
