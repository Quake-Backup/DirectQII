Timer catch up from debug break

dropped frames in cinematics (it's 2018, this shouldn't happen)

GLimp_AppActivate - does DXGI not do this for us????

Test video mode stuff with a clean config.

CVAR_VIDEO should not write to console if in the menus

Music sometimes stops when it shouldn't...

we have the palette on the VS as a texture so read it as a colour for beams (how???)

beam transform is messy - this should be quick and easy to calculate...

reduce number of cbuffers

shaders as embedded resources: 1: get them into the renderer lib, and 2: get a recompile of resources if they change.

Add apply changes status bar to video options that need them, vsync shouldn't need it

Make a Com_ValidatePath for all the little cases of paths with "..", ".\", "./", etc.

Save/Load menu with mapshots/etc

Discard-free buffers: https://www.gamedevs.org/uploads/efficient-buffer-management.pdf

vertex cache optimization

cBuffer updates via Map/Discard.
Don't update if nothing has changed (this may be more expensive to check than just updating...)

/**************************************/
/* Best way to group dlights cbuffer. */
/**************************************/
- draw instanced, adding dlight params as per-instance attribs with start instance being the dl num and num instances being 1, passing anything the PS needs
  along to it via the PS_DYNAMICLIGHT struct
- make MAX_DLIGHTS cBuffers binding the appropriate one as each light passes
- use 11.1 cbuffer ranges
- just keep it as it, updating as required for each light (we can revert the recent change if so)
- something else???




Batch updates to dynamic buffers (the code for this could get nasty...)
