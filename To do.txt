Video menu stuff
Timer catch up from debug break
Split out mmdl_t from dmdl_t, remove offsets and replace with pointers, don't store everything in memory.

"refusing to download a path with .." - for these
models/monsters/tank/../ctank/skin.pcx
models/monsters/ctank/skin.pcx

models/monsters/tank/../ctank/pain.pcx

Find out where they're coming from and either fix it or put in a workaround.
these are stored in the model skins and can't be removed without editing the model; content bug.
they could be removed at load-time however...

dropped frames in cinematics (it's 2018, this shouldn't happen)
implement ri.Set2D/ri.End2D and bring on framework for vid.conwidth/vid.conheight

upscale pics/charset/numbers (but NOT conback) so that they'll look good at zoomed ortho views

GLimp_AppActivate - does DXGI not do this for us????

Test video mode stuff with a clean config.
Link directly to DirectSound instead of using GPA

fixme - zone allocated stuff should be freed when the reflib shuts down
create a separate heap for the reflib and alloc from that instead!!!
then just destroy that heap when the reflib is destroyed, recreate it when the reflib is recreated
